# XL4015 Breakout Board

XL4015 DC-DC Buck Inverter Breakout Board. Primarily made to practice routing and polygon pours, as well as expand my knowledge in the field of power electronics.

**Software used: KiCad**

There are certain polygon pours that are GND layers. Now that Iâ€™m writing this, maybe having the entire bottom layer be GND may be cleaner in design as well as easy to scale in terms of adding more components.
